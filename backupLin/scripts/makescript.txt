# first we need to create a file using:

nano script_name.sh
#remember to add .sh at the end for it to act like a script

# write all the commands sequentially and save it

#now its the time to make this script executable the command is:

chmod +x script_name.sh

# now that the script is executable lets just run it, be in the same director:

./script_name.sh
